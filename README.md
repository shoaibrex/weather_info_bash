A simple `bashscript` for fetching weather info from an `API` using `curl` and then displaying that info in `shell`. I created this script for devops learning purposes.
## Usage:
Add your `API_KEY` after registering on [Site](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_upLinks) and run 
`bash weather_script.sh CITY_NAME`
